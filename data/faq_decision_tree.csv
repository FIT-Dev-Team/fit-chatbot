📊 Analytics & Methodology,Baseline,How is the baseline calculated?,"Food waste is measured over a defined period to establish an average that reflects normal operations across shifts, categories, and waste types. This average becomes the baseline for comparison."
📊 Analytics & Methodology,Baseline,How is the baseline used?,"Once the baseline is established, future performance (post-baseline) is compared to measure improvement or savings."
📊 Analytics & Methodology,Baseline,What does post-baseline mean?,Post-baseline refers to the time after implementing waste-reduction actions. The system automatically compares it to baseline data to calculate progress.
📊 Analytics & Methodology,Baseline,What is 'Baseline vs Post-Baseline' in the report?,Baseline shows your starting point before intervention; Post-Baseline shows the period after actions. The comparison demonstrates improvement over time.
📊 Analytics & Methodology,Baseline,What is the baseline period?,The baseline is your reference period before starting any waste-reduction actions. It defines your 'normal' waste pattern and allows for future comparisons.

📦 General Information,Miscellaneous,Why do I need to add covers?,"Our main KPI is food waste per cover. Tracking only the average amount of food waste is not sufficient — this metric enables fair comparison across different days, sites, and service volumes. That’s why we require the number of covers."
📦 General Information,Miscellaneous,"Why does FIT categorize by shift, category, and type?","By breaking waste down by shift, category (prep, spoilage, plate), and type (like vegetables or meat), you can see more clearly when, where, and why it happens — making it easier to focus on the right fixes"
📦 General Information,Miscellaneous,Why is kg/day not always correlated with g/cover?,"Kg/day captures overall waste volume, whereas g/cover accounts for meals served, enabling fair benchmarking. When covers decline, kg/day may decrease while g/cover remains stable or rises. Together, these metrics provide complementary insights into both scale and efficiency"
📦 General Information,Miscellaneous,Why is my data marked as missing?,"If covers or one of the waste categories is missing, FIT flags the set as incomplete. Please review and fill in the missing information to make it complete."
