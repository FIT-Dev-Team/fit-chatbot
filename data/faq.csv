Thanks,"You're welcome! If you need anything else, I'm happy to assist."
"What data does the FIT system collect, and how is it used?","FIT collects data on the amount, type, reason, and timing of food waste. This information is analyzed to identify patterns, improvement areas, and the impact of reduction strategies. Real‑time dashboards and regular reports then summarize trends and results."
What equipment is needed to get started?,"You’ll need a digital scale compatible with FIT software (recommended), along with a tablet or smartphone to log waste data, and an internet connection to sync with the cloud. We provide full installation support."
What happens if a team member enters the wrong data?,Mistakes happen! You can edit entries in the Add Data section on the FIT website. Then go to History and update the record to ensure the data points are accurate.
What is food waste per cover?,"Food waste per cover is calculated as total food waste (kg) divided by total covers (guests). It represents the amount of waste per guest — the lower the number, the better."
What is data consistency?,"Data consistency refers to the reliability of recorded waste data. Accurate, complete, and regular entries are essential to generate valid insights and support effective decision‑making."
"What is food waste per cover (g/cover), and why do we use it?","Food waste per cover (g/cover) measures the amount of waste generated per guest. It is a key KPI because it normalizes for volume, allowing kitchens of different sizes to compare efficiency"
"What is the FIT Food Waste Monitoring System, and how does it work?","The FIT system helps reduce food waste in commercial kitchens by tracking waste during preparation, spoilage, and plate waste. By measuring food waste at various points, it identifies inefficiencies and supports the implementation of waste-reduction strategies to enhance kitchen efficiency."
What is the Price of FIT?,The price of the FIT system is based on your specific requirements and the number of recording points and kitchens. Please contact us to get a personalized quote and more information about pricing options.
What is the baseline?,The baseline is simply your starting point — the first measurement of food waste before changes are made. It’s what you’ll compare against later to see how effective your reduction efforts are.
What is the 'Waiting List' feature?,"The 'Waiting List'  temporarily stores offline entries for FIT mobile app users. Once Wi-Fi is back, press upload to sync data to the server."
What kind of food waste reduction can we expect to see using your system?,"On average, our clients achieve up to a 30% reduction in food waste after implementation"
What makes you different from other food waste tech solutions?,"Unlike many solutions that provide only technology, we combine tech with hands‑on human support. Our team delivers training, consulting, and ongoing engagement to ensure you achieve your food waste reduction goals — not just track them."
What results can we expect from implementing the FIT system?,"Our clients usually see real results: less food waste, lower disposal costs, and smarter use of ingredients — all adding up to better efficiency and sustainability"
What support do you provide after setup?,"We’re here for you with ongoing support, check‑ins, and guidance — helping you succeed not just with the tech, but with the behavior changes that make a real difference"
When do I enter covers?,"Enter the total number of covers at the end of each shift, once service is completed and the actual guests served are known."
Who can I contact for additional support or questions?,"You can check the Help section for general tutorials. For more detailed inquiries, please contact your FIT consultant or email fit@lightblueconsulting.com"
Why do I need to add covers?,"Our main KPI is food waste per cover. Tracking only the average amount of food waste is not sufficient — this metric enables fair comparison across different days, sites, and service volumes. That’s why we require the number of covers."
"Why does FIT categorize by shift, category, and type?","By breaking waste down by shift, category (prep, spoilage, plate), and type (like vegetables or meat), you can see more clearly when, where, and why it happens — making it easier to focus on the right fixes"
Why is kg/day not always correlated with g/cover?,"Kg/day captures overall waste volume, whereas g/cover accounts for meals served, enabling fair benchmarking. When covers decline, kg/day may decrease while g/cover remains stable or rises. Together, these metrics provide complementary insights into both scale and efficiency"

"
What is a complete set?,"A complete set means both the mandatory food waste category and the number of covers are entered. This allows FIT to calculate food waste per cover. The more complete sets recorded, the higher the percentage of data consistency. For the production kitchen, all mandatory food waste categories must be filled during the shift."
Why is my data marked as missing?,"If covers or one of the waste categories is missing, FIT flags the set as incomplete. Please review and fill in the missing information to make it complete."
How can I check what data is missing?,"Go to ‘On demand’, select your preferred period and kitchen. Any missing records will be highlighted in yellow."
What does a low food waste per cover mean?,"A lower food waste per cover means you waste less food per guest served - indicating efficient portioning, menu planning, and staff awareness."
What is the baseline period?,The baseline is your reference period before starting any waste-reduction actions. It defines your 'normal' waste pattern and allows for future comparisons.
How is the baseline used?,"Once the baseline is established, future performance (post-baseline) is compared to measure improvement or savings."
What does post-baseline mean?,Post-baseline refers to the time after implementing waste-reduction actions. The system automatically compares it to baseline data to calculate progress.
What is data consistency?,"Data consistency measures the reliability and regularity of your records. Complete, correctly filled data leads to high consistency scores."
How can I improve my data consistency?,"Record data daily, ensure covers are entered correctly, and avoid leaving shifts incomplete. Regular habits lead to consistent, trustworthy data."
How do I switch between kitchens?,Use the dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard to select a different kitchen or site.
What is 'Baseline vs Post-Baseline' in the report?,Baseline shows your starting point before intervention; Post-Baseline shows the period after actions. The comparison demonstrates improvement over time.
What time zone does FIT use?,"Each site operates in its own configured local time zone, set during onboarding or FIT registration form since very beginning."
