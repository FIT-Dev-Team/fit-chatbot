Question?,answer
Thanks,"You’re welcome! If you need anything else, just ask."
"What data does the FIT system collect, and how is it used?","FIT collects amount, type, reason, and timing of food waste. This data is analyzed to identify patterns, improvement areas, and the impact of reduction strategies. Real-time dashboards and regular reports summarize trends and results."
What equipment is needed to get started?,"you’ll need a digital scale compatible with the FIT software, a tablet or smartphone for logging waste data, and an internet connection for syncing data to the cloud. FIT provides all necessary hardware and installation support."
What happens if a team member enters the wrong data?,"Mistakes happen! Entries can be edited in the ""on demand"" section on the FIT website to ensure the data points are accurate"
What is FWCV?,FWCV = total food waste (kg) ÷ total covers (guests). It shows waste per guest — lower is better.
What is data consistency?,"Data consistency is the reliability of recorded waste data. Accurate, complete, and regular entries are essential for valid insights and effective decision-making."
"What is food waste per cover (g/cover), and why do we use it?","Food waste per cover (g/cover) measures waste generated per meal served. It is a key KPI because it normalizes for volume, enabling kitchens of different sizes to compare efficiency."
"What is the FIT Food Waste Monitoring System, and how does it work?","The FIT system helps reduce food waste in commercial kitchens by tracking waste during preparation, spoilage, and plate waste. By measuring food waste at various points, it identifies inefficiencies and supports the implementation of waste-reduction strategies to enhance kitchen efficiency."
What is the Price of FIT?,The price of the FIT system is based on your specific requirements and the number of recording points and kitchens. Please contact us to get a personalized quote and more information about pricing options.
What is the baseline?,The baseline is the initial measurement of food waste before interventions. It serves as the reference point to measure the effectiveness of future reduction efforts.
What is the ‘Waiting List’ feature?,"The ‘Waiting List’ temporarily stores offline entries. Once Wi-Fi is back, press upload to sync data to the server."
What kind of food waste reduction can we expect to see using your system?,"On average, our clients see up to a 30% reduction in food waste after implementation."
What makes you different from other food waste tech solutions?,"Unlike many solutions that offer just the tech, we combine technology with hands-on human support. Our team provides training, consulting, and ongoing engagement to make sure you actually achieve your food waste reduction goals—not just track them."

When do I enter covers?,Enter total covers at the end of each shift once service is completed and you know the actual guests served.
Who can I contact for additional support or questions?,Use the in-app Help section or contact the support team via the provided contact details.
Why do I need to add covers?,"Covers (meals served) normalize waste data so metrics like grams per cover (g/cover) can be calculated, allowing fair comparison across days, sites, and service volumes."
"Why does FIT categorize by shift, category, and type?","Granular categorization by shift, category (e.g., vegetables, meat), and type (prep, spoilage, plate) enables deeper insight into when, where, and why waste occurs, helping target the right improvements."
Why is kg/day not always correlated with g/cover?,"Kg/day is total waste; g/cover normalizes by meals served. If covers drop, kg/day may fall while g/cover stays flat or rises. The two metrics answer different questions."
