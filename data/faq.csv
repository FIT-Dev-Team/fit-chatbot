Question?,answer
Thanks,"You’re welcome! If you need anything else, just ask."
"What data does the FIT system collect, and how is it used?","FIT collects amount, type, reason, and timing of food waste. This data is analyzed to identify patterns, improvement areas, and the impact of reduction strategies. Real-time dashboards and regular reports summarize trends and results."
What equipment is needed to get started?,"you’ll need a digital scale compatible with the FIT software, a tablet or smartphone for logging waste data, and an internet connection for syncing data to the cloud. FIT provides all necessary hardware and installation support."
What happens if a team member enters the wrong data?,"Mistakes happen! Entries can be edited in the ""on demand"" section on the FIT website to ensure the data points are accurate"
What is FWCV?,FWCV = total food waste (kg) ÷ total covers (guests). It shows waste per guest — lower is better.
What is data consistency?,"Data consistency is the reliability of recorded waste data. Accurate, complete, and regular entries are essential for valid insights and effective decision-making."
"What is food waste per cover (g/cover), and why do we use it?","Food waste per cover (g/cover) measures waste generated per meal served. It is a key KPI because it normalizes for volume, enabling kitchens of different sizes to compare efficiency."
"What is the FIT Food Waste Monitoring System, and how does it work?","The FIT system helps reduce food waste in commercial kitchens by tracking waste during preparation, spoilage, and plate waste. By measuring food waste at various points, it identifies inefficiencies and supports the implementation of waste-reduction strategies to enhance kitchen efficiency."
What is the Price of FIT?,The price of the FIT system is based on your specific requirements and the number of recording points and kitchens. Please contact us to get a personalized quote and more information about pricing options.
What is the baseline?,The baseline is the initial measurement of food waste before interventions. It serves as the reference point to measure the effectiveness of future reduction efforts.
What is the ‘Waiting List’ feature?,"The ‘Waiting List’ temporarily stores offline entries. Once Wi-Fi is back, press upload to sync data to the server."
What kind of food waste reduction can we expect to see using your system?,"On average, our clients see up to a 30% reduction in food waste after implementation."
What makes you different from other food waste tech solutions?,"Unlike many solutions that offer just the tech, we combine technology with hands-on human support. Our team provides training, consulting, and ongoing engagement to make sure you actually achieve your food waste reduction goals—not just track them."

When do I enter covers?,Enter total covers at the end of each shift once service is completed and you know the actual guests served.
Who can I contact for additional support or questions?,Use the in-app Help section or contact the support team via the provided contact details.
Why do I need to add covers?,"Covers (meals served) normalize waste data so metrics like grams per cover (g/cover) can be calculated, allowing fair comparison across days, sites, and service volumes."
"Why does FIT categorize by shift, category, and type?","Granular categorization by shift, category (e.g., vegetables, meat), and type (prep, spoilage, plate) enables deeper insight into when, where, and why waste occurs, helping target the right improvements."
Why is kg/day not always correlated with g/cover?,"Kg/day is total waste; g/cover normalizes by meals served. If covers drop, kg/day may fall while g/cover stays flat or rises. The two metrics answer different questions."

What is a COMPLETE set?,"A COMPLETE set means a record where all required fields are filled in correctly — food waste data, covers, shift, and category. Only COMPLETE sets are counted in KPI reports."
Why is my data marked as INCOMPLETE?,"If covers or one of the waste categories is missing, FIT flags the set as INCOMPLETE. Please review and fill in the missing information to make it COMPLETE."
How can I check which sets are incomplete?,"Go to the Dashboard or Missing Data tab — incomplete sets will be highlighted. You can click each to edit and fill missing covers or waste entries."
What is the difference between COMPLETE and VALID data?,"COMPLETE means all fields are filled. VALID means data also passes logic checks — for example, covers > 0, waste values reasonable, and shifts consistent with time."
Why do I need to mark a set COMPLETE?,"Marking a set COMPLETE confirms all data for that shift is final. It ensures reports and FWCV calculations reflect accurate, approved data."
What is FWCV?,"FWCV (Food Waste Cost per Visitor) measures the amount of food waste per guest. It helps you understand efficiency and compare performance between sites or time periods."
How is FWCV calculated?,"FWCV = Total Food Waste (kg) ÷ Total Covers (guests). The lower the value, the better the performance."
What does a low FWCV mean?,"A lower FWCV means you waste less food per guest served — indicating efficient portioning, menu planning, and staff awareness."
What is the baseline period?,"The baseline is your reference period before starting any waste-reduction actions. It defines your 'normal' waste pattern and allows for future comparisons."
How is the baseline used?,"Once the baseline is established, future performance (post-baseline) is compared to measure improvement or savings."
What does post-baseline mean?,"Post-baseline refers to the time after implementing waste-reduction actions. The system automatically compares it to baseline data to calculate progress."
What is data consistency?,"Data consistency measures the reliability and regularity of your records. Complete, correctly filled data leads to high consistency scores."
How can I improve my data consistency?,"Record data daily, ensure covers are entered correctly, and avoid leaving shifts incomplete. Regular habits lead to consistent, trustworthy data."
How to export a monthly report?,"Go to Reports → Monthly → choose your date range and site → click 'Export'. You can export CSV or Excel summaries including FWCV, total waste, and breakdowns."
How to export raw data?,"In Reports → Raw Data, select your date range and kitchen, then click Export. This provides full details of each entry for deeper analysis."
How to interpret FWCV changes?,"Compare your weekly or monthly FWCV. If it drops, your kitchen is improving. If it increases, check for changes in covers, menu, or logging accuracy."
When should I enter covers?,"Enter covers at the end of each shift when service has finished and the actual number of guests is known."
Can I edit covers later?,"Yes, if you have Editor or Admin access. Go to Add Data → Covers → select date and shift → edit → save."
What if my covers = 0 but waste > 0?,"This is usually a missing data error. Verify the covers value and correct it — otherwise the FWCV may appear inflated."
How do smart scales connect?,"FIT smart scales connect to tablets via Bluetooth. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled, select your scale ID in the app, and pair."
How to reconnect a scale that stopped working?,"Turn the scale off and on, then tap Reconnect in the FIT Scale App. Check Bluetooth permissions and battery levels."
Which scale models are supported?,"FIT supports models approved by LightBlue Consulting. Contact support for the latest list of compatible smart scales."
What is the FIT for Event module?,"FIT for Event is designed for banquets and special events. It helps you track food waste per event style — Set Menu, Buffet, Banquet, etc. — to measure efficiency per format."
What are Event Styles?,"Event Styles describe the food service type: Set Menu, Banquet, Cocktail, Family Style, or Coffee Break. They help classify data for comparison across service types."
Why am I getting 'Missing Data' emails?,"FIT automatically detects shifts or days without COMPLETE data and sends reminders to ensure your reports remain accurate."
How do I fix missing data?,"Click the Missing Data alert → review the listed shifts → enter missing covers or waste → mark COMPLETE."
What is 'Data Validation'?,"Data validation checks if your records make sense — for example, prevents entries with 0 covers but high waste, or missing shift times."
How to request support?,"Email support@lightblueconsulting.com or contact your FIT representative. Include the date, site, and a brief description of the issue."
What KPIs does FIT track?,"FIT tracks Total Food Waste (kg), FWCV (kg/cover), Covers, Savings, and Breakdown by category or event style."
What does Savings mean?,"Savings represent how much waste (and cost) you’ve reduced compared to your baseline — calculated from food cost per kg and reduction in total waste."
How do I analyze weekly performance?,"Use the Dashboard → Weekly Trends to compare FWCV, total waste, and category breakdowns. Look for consistent improvements or anomalies."
What is the most common reason for high FWCV?,"Usually missing covers or incomplete data entries. Always check covers and ensure all shifts are marked COMPLETE."
How does FIT use my data?,"FIT stores and analyzes waste data to calculate KPIs and generate dashboards. Data is kept confidential and accessible only to authorized users."
